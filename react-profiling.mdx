## Profiling Production React Apps

---

# What?

<Notes>
  React introduced a new profiler for checking the speed of your app rendering.
  Makes it easy to get timing events and see what might be slowing down your
  renders
</Notes>

---

# [RFC](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/51) && [Blog Post](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/09/10/introducing-the-react-profiler.html)

<Notes>
  Not going to spend a lot of time on the implementation. There is a great RFC
  and blog post from the React team about this.
</Notes>

<Notes>
  Here is the GUI profiler, which can be used in development to see a visual
  representation of your profiling events
</Notes>

---

### Allows you to get timings of components events

---

# What events?

---

## Mounts and updates!

---

# Let's look at an example!

---

### Note: [It takes a bit of setup for production](https://gist.github.com/bvaughn/25e6233aeb1b4f0cdb8d8366e54a3977)

<Notes>
  You have to explicitly tell React to use the profiler in Production!
</Notes>

---

## Let's look at some code

---

```js
import React, { unstable_Profiler as ReactProfiler } from "react";
const Profiled = ({ children }) => (
  <ReactProfiler id={"Profiler Identifier"} onRender={handleProfiler}>
    {children}
  </ReactProfiler>
);
```
